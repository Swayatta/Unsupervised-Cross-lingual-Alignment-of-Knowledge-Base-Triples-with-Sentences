# Unsupervised-Cross-lingual-alignment-of-Knowledge-BaseTriples-with-Sentences
This project aims to utilise a high resource language ( English) to create an aligned corpus of sentences in a low resource language (Hindi) in a cross-lingual sentting.
We experiment with various static embedding based methods and dynamic contextualised representations using multilingual transformer based models. These lead to strong baselines. We also propose two novel methods for improving on these baselines. We use a gold standard human annotated dataset from multple domains for our evaluation purposes. 
We report significant improvement on evaluating our novel methods on these datasets. This leads to the conclusion that our introduced methods are form an effective basis for cross-lingual alignment task. 
Utilising these alignment models, we create a cross-lingual aligned corpus of English fact triples aligned with Hindi sentences. This corpus, we believe, can be utilised for several downstream tasks like multilingual data-to-text generation, question answering, knowledge base population, knowledge graph completion etc.
We make our code and final aligned corpus publicly available.
